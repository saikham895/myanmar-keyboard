This project is to create keyboard for Myanmar/Burma. Firstly, a keyboard for Myanmar/Zawgyi font is created for Android phones.

The [Android Myanmar Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmswdev.mmkeyboard) is based on [Hacker's Keyboard](https://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/). Keyboard for Zawgyi font is added and all other languages except English are removed. The purpose of Hacker's Keyboard is to replicate the PC keyboard on Android devices. It makes it better for Myanmar fonts since there'd be enough keys to enter all the characters.

Auto-completion requires a separate add-on. Add-on for Zawgyi can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmswdev.mmlangpack.my_zg). It would definitely need more phrases added into. Feel free to send in suggestions.
